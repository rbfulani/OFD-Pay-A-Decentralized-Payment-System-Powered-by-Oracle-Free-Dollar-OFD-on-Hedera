OFD-Pay is a decentralized payment platform built on the Hedera network, designed to enable fast, trustless, and cost-efficient digital payments using the Oracle-Free Dollar (OFD) stablecoin. The project integrates the OFD protocol—a trustless stablecoin model forked from Frankencoin—eliminating oracle dependency while ensuring full decentralization and transparency.

Traditional stablecoins rely on centralized oracles for price feeds, which introduces single points of failure and governance risks. OFD-Pay leverages Hedera’s high-speed, low-fee distributed ledger and OFD’s oracle-free minting mechanism to create a robust payment system that functions entirely on-chain, without third-party intermediaries.

Through OFD-Pay, users can mint, hold, and transact OFD tokens seamlessly. Merchants and individuals can accept OFD as a form of payment, and smart contracts automatically handle conversions and settlements, ensuring stable USD-backed value without external dependencies.

The system introduces a “Pay-with-OFD” API and a lightweight wallet integration for businesses. Developers can easily embed the payment button on e-commerce sites, donation platforms, or mobile apps. All transactions are recorded immutably on Hedera’s DLT, ensuring auditability and security.

By combining the OFD stablecoin’s oracle-free design with Hedera’s performance, OFD-Pay demonstrates a scalable solution for decentralized commerce and peer-to-peer payments. This integration empowers users across DeFi, microfinance, and global remittance ecosystems with reliable, censorship-resistant digital money.
